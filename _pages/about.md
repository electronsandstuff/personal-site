I am a postdoc with [Young-Kee Kim](https://hep.uchicago.edu/~ykkim/index.shtml) at the University of Chicago.
There, we are exploring scientific machine learning and how it can be used to improve the design and operation of particle accelerators and electron microscopes.
I also ocasionally do research and development on high brightness photocathode electron sources.
Right now, I am particularly interested in using [neural networks with physics informed priors](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.10.045) to develop fast and differentiable models of high intensity particle beams.

I am passionate about open science and open source scientific software.
You can sometimes see me around [github](https://github.com/electronsandstuff).
I also developed and operate [The Photocathode Database](https://photocathodes.io/), an aggregator of published data of photocathode materials.
Outside of the lab, I am an avid electronics enthusiast and love any project that helps to reveal the often weird side of nature at home and at a hobbyist accessible budget.
I will shill for the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language if you give me a chance.
