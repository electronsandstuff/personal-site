As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, I am working with physicist [Young-Kee Kim](https://hep.uchicago.edu/~ykkim/index.shtml) to investigate the intersection of accelerator physics and machine learning.
Our research focuses on using machine learning techniques to enhance the design and performance of photoinjectors, x-ray light sources, and electron microscopes.
Currently, I am particularly interested in leveraging neural networks with physics-informed priors to create efficient, data-driven, and differentiable models of high intensity particle beams.
I am also engaged in the research and development of high brightness photocathode materials.

I am committed to the principles of open science and the use of open source scientific software. 
I created and run [The Photocathode Database](https://photocathodes.io/), a platform for compiling and distributing published data on photocathode materials.
Check out my [github](https://github.com/electronsandstuff) for code written by me.
In my free time, I am an avid electronics hobbyist, who enjoys exploring the quirks of nature through projects that are accessible and affordable.
