Hi there!
I am a researcher studying [accelerator physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerator_physics) at the University of Chicago.
My research interests include advanced photocathodes, ultrafast science, and the applications of machine learning to physics.

Check me out at the following socials! <br/>

# What is Chris up to?
I have just successfully defended my thesis! I am now performing a few measurements in Berkeley before continuing on to Chicago to work on ML in physics.
