Hi there!
I am a PhD student studying [accelerator physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerator_physics) at Cornell University.
My research interests include advanced optimization techniques, photocathode design / characterization, ultrafast science, and the applications of machine learning to physics.

Check me out at the following socials! <br/>

# What is Chris doing now?
I just arrived back at Cornell to finish up the last year of my degree.
I was previously at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab studying nanoscale electron emitters.
