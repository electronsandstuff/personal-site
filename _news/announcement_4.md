The final paper of my Ph.D. is up on arXiv! This is some interesting work where we characterize, for the first time, the brightness of nanogroove enhanced photoemitters with applications for high average current photoinjectors. Check it out here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05056).
