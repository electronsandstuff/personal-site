Excited to announce the release of [ParetoBench](https://github.com/electronsandstuff/ParetoBench), a Python library for multi-objective optimization algorithm benchmarking! The package includes common test problems, tools for statistical analysis of convergence results, and objects for manipulating and saving results from benchmarking experiments.
