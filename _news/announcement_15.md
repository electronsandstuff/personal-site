Check out my latest article out now in Swarm and Evolutionary Computation.
A "comparison relationship surrogate" model is shown to improve the efficiency of a multi-objective genetic optimizer.
The new algorithm (CRSEA) was measured to outperform many contemporary surrogate assisted optimizers on a wide variety of *biobjective, medium scale* problems.
Find it on [the journal's website](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2025.101947) or see its preprint available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19411).
