Say hi to me at the ICFA Beam Dynamics Mini-Workshop on Machine Learning Applications for Particle Accelerators! I am there presenting some of my work on how surrogate models can be installed into genetic algorithms and greatly improve the efficiency of multi-objective optimizations of accelerators.
