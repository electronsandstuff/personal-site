Pleased to have contributed to ["Harnessing Plasmonic Interference for Nanoscale Ultrafast Electron Sources"](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.185001) out now in Physical Review Letters. The work demonstrates a novel approach to creating nanoscale electron sources using plasmonic focusing, achieving sub-40 pm-rad normalized transverse emittance.
